## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned & Continued development

I had completely forgotten about pseudo classes in CSS and when faced with a font change in the text, I decided to take this option. The truth is that I found it quite useful and it was what I was looking for.

```css
.stats:last-child > span {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
```
I have felt comfortable with the challenge, without a doubt I think I can use a framework to make the design more adaptable to more devices. But I feel like I made the code as reusable as possible and I'm satisfied with the work. Although I recognize that there are parts that can be improved, but I'm happy to have completed this challenge.
